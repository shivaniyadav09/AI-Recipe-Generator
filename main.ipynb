      "*   **Water:** 4 cups (950ml) – Use filtered water for the best flavour.\n",
      "*   **Whole Milk (or Plant-Based Alternative):** 1 cup (240ml) – Whole milk provides richness, but almond, oat, or soy milk are great dairy-free options.\n",
      "*   **Black Tea Bags (or Loose Leaf):** 4 bags (or 2 tablespoons loose leaf) – Assam or Darjeeling are excellent choices.  English Breakfast also works well.\n",
      "*   **Cinnamon Sticks:** 2 (3-inch sticks) – Adds warmth and sweetness.\n",
      "*   **Green Cardamom Pods:** 8-10, lightly crushed – For a floral, citrusy note.\n",
      "*   **Fresh Ginger:** 1-inch piece, peeled and thinly sliced – Adds a spicy, zesty kick.\n",
      "*   **Whole Cloves:** 6-8 – Adds a warm, pungent flavour.\n",
      "*   **Black Peppercorns:** 4-6 – For a subtle spicy heat. (Optional, but recommended!)\n",
      "*   **Sweetener of Choice:** Honey, maple syrup, granulated sugar, brown sugar, or your preferred alternative, to taste.\n",
      "*   **Optional additions:** Vanilla extract (1/2 tsp), star anise (1), fennel seeds (1/4 tsp)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Equipment:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Medium saucepan\n",
      "*   Measuring cups and spoons\n",
      "*   Knife and cutting board\n",
      "*   Strainer (optional, but recommended)\n",
      "*   Mugs for serving\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Spice Infusion:** In a medium saucepan, combine the water, cinnamon sticks, crushed cardamom pods, sliced ginger, cloves, and peppercorns (if using).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Bring to a Boil:** Bring the mixture to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. This ensures the spices release their full aroma and flavour.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Simmer & Steep:** Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan, and simmer gently for 20 minutes. Simmering allows the spices to infuse into the water, creating a concentrated chai base.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Add Tea & Milk:** After simmering, remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the black tea bags (or loose leaf) and milk. Stir gently to combine.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Final Simmer:** Return the saucepan to low heat and simmer for an additional 3-5 minutes. Be careful not to let the mixture boil over, as this can scorch the milk.  This step allows the tea to steep and the milk to warm through, creating a creamy texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Sweeten & Serve:** Remove the saucepan from the heat.  Add your sweetener of choice to taste. Stir well until the sweetener is fully dissolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Strain (Optional):** For a smoother tea, strain the mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a heatproof pitcher or directly into mugs. This removes the spices and tea leaves. If you prefer a more rustic chai, skip the straining.\n",
      "\n",
      "8.  **Serve Immediately:** Pour the chai tea into mugs and serve immediately. Enjoy the warmth and aromatic spices!\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips & Alternatives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Spice Variations:** Experiment with different spices to create your own unique chai blend. Consider adding a star anise, fennel seeds, or a pinch of nutmeg for added complexity.\n",
      "*   **Freshness Matters:** Use fresh, whole spices for the best flavour. Ground spices will work in a pinch, but the flavour will be less vibrant.\n",
      "*   **Loose Leaf Tea:** Using loose leaf tea can provide a more nuanced flavour compared to tea bags.  Increase steeping time by 1-2 minutes.\n",
      "*   **Plant-Based Chai:** For a vegan chai, use your favourite plant-based milk alternative. Oat milk and soy milk tend to create a richer texture.\n",
      "*   **Iced Chai:**  Let the strained chai cool completely, then pour over ice. Add a splash of milk or sweetener if desired.\n",
      "*   **Concentrated Chai:** Simmer the spices in a smaller amount of water (e.g., 2 cups) for a more concentrated chai base. You can then add milk and water to dilute it to your desired strength. This is great for making chai lattes!\n",
      "*   **Adjusting Spice Levels:** Increase the amount of ginger, cloves, or pepper to get desired spice level.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cooking Suggestions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Watch the Milk:** Keep a close eye on the milk while simmering to prevent it from scorching.\n",
      "*   **Strain While Hot:** Straining the chai while it's still hot makes it easier to remove the spices.\n",
      "*   **Adjust Sweetness:** Add the sweetener gradually, tasting as you go, to achieve your desired level of sweetness.\n",
      "*   **Steeping Time:** The longer you steep the tea, the stronger the flavour will be.  Be careful not to over-steep, as this can lead to a bitter taste. 3-5 minutes is generally ideal.\n",
      "\n",
